# 3D Printed T-Slot Nut

This provides a 3d-printable housing to be able to use cheap square nuts as t-slot nuts for aluminium extrusions. I
suspect that the plastic will compress over time under load, loosening the joint, but it seems to work well so far.

## Why?

The metal version is probably better but at
[20 INR a piece](https://robu.in/product/t-type-m4-nut-for-20x20-aluminium-profile-10-pcs/) the cost seems to add up
quite fast, having to reprint and tighten the joints again every year or so doesn't seem like that big an inconvenience
compared to the cost-savings. On a shoestring budget, it seems to better to spend money on parts that have a greater
impact on print quality in general.
