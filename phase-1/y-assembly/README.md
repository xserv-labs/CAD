# Y Assembly

I could have just used a laser cut mdf carriage, but I'd either have to order one or ask a friend and considering phase
1 is filled with temporary solutions, it does not make sense to invest in a proper carriage, and so I've designed and
printed parts that will attach to a thin acrylic sheet (sourced from a transparent clipboard, which is available on just
about every stationery shop) to achieve somewhat of a proper y-carriage.
